<h2 align="center">Using the ORDS listener to replace modplsql</h2>

<h4 align="center" class="blue"><i>Doug McMahon</i></h4>

<h4 align="center" class="red">Updated August 3, 2018</h4>

<p>
I wrote this informal how-to guide for the benefit of users who want to
migrate off of mod_owa to the ORDS listener, as well as for users who are
using Oracle's modplsql and facing the deprecation of that facility. These
are just my own notes and not an official migration guide, something I'm
hoping Oracle will produce. I had some difficulty getting things working,
and as part of that process I looked at blog posts and discussion threads,
and I realized that there is a general lack of knowledge about how to do
this. I wrote this guide while using ORDS version 3.0.3.351.13.24, so be
aware that changes to the scripted parts may have taken place since this
was written.
</p>

<p>
ORDS stands for <i>Oracle REST Data Services</i>. The ORDS listener is
a Java servlet that is capable of functioning as a PL/SQL gateway
listener. It was formerly called the Apex listener - basically it's the
same code, extended for REST and refactored so it can be used separately
from Apex for pure REST applications. When used as a PL/SQL gateway,
the ORDS listener does exactly what modplsql and mod_owa do: it receives
HTTP requests, parses the URIs and ingests other header values, and forms
a call to a PL/SQL package/procedure to execute the request. It then
uses the standard OWA infrastructure to receive the response, which it
returns to the client. modplsql and mod_owa rely on an Apache server
to handle the actual HTTP socket operations - they are <i>plug-ins</i>.
ORDS can similarly be used within a Java Web Application Server, where
it runs as a Java <i>servlet</i>. ORDS also comes with a built-in app
server, Jetty, which allows it to be run in a stand-alone mode.
</p>

<h4>Concepts</h4>

<dir>

<p>
Here are some conceptual things that I wish I had understood prior to trying
to install and configure ORDS.
</p>

<dl>

<dt><b>modplsql Data Access Descriptor (DAD)</b></dt>
<dd>
This is a basic unit of configuration in modplsql. Among other things,
you can establish a method of connecting to your database (e.g. a username,
password, and database connect string), as well as a URL path by which to
execute PL/SQL commands for your application.
</dd>

<dt><b>Apache Location</b></dt>
<dd>
This is a basic unit of configuration in Apache and for mod_owa. With
mod_owa, you use an Apache Location to map the OWA service to a URL within
Apache. This is also the place where you set up your database connection
information.
</dd>

<dt><b>ORDS &quot;database&quot;</b></dt>
<dd>
This seems to configure a database connection pool within ORDS. When you
perform the <tt><b>setup --database</b></tt> command, you are configuring
a pool of connections. This corresponds to the database half of a
modplsql DAD or mod_owa Location.
</dd>

<dt><b>ORDS URL mapping</b></dt>
<dd>
This is equivalent to the URL mapping half of the modplsql DAD or mod_owa
Location. You associate a URL mapping with your database connection.
</dd>

<dt><b>JDBC Proxy Connections</b></dt>
<dd>
The REST part of ORDS is able to use so-called <i>proxy</i> connections to
the RDBMS. This allows ORDS to have a single connection pool with all the
connections to a public user account. When a request comes in that needs to
be run against another database user/schema, it's able to leverage one of these
connections to proxy into the desired user/schema, run the command, and then
exit the proxy. In this way, ORDS need not have separate connection pools
for every possible database user/schema that has a REST service.
</dd>

</dl>

<p>
If I had understood that I needed to create both a database and a URL mapping
in order to run my PL/SQL application, I would have saved myself a lot of
grief! Also, it appears that while REST operations use the proxy connection
feature, PL/SQL gateway operations don't or can't - this is another thing
that I wish I'd understood before attempting to get ORDS running as a
PL/SQL gateway!
</p>

</dir>

<h4>Download</h4>

<dir>

<p>
ORDS is delivered as a .zip file. As of this writing, you can download it
from here: <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/rest-data-services/downloads/index.html">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/rest-data-services/downloads/index.html</a>.
</p>

<p>
Unzip it to a working directory. This is where you will run some installation
and configuration steps. The unzipped image will include
<tt><b>ords.war</b></tt>, which is the main deployable body of ORDS code
and resources. It will also include some sub-directories, in particular
<tt><b>params/</b></tt>. I will refer to this directory as the <u>install</u>
directory.
</p>

<blockquote>
<b>
<p class="red">
Important: make copies of ords.war and params/ords_params.properties before
doing anything else! If you make any mistakes during the subsequent steps,
some steps become unrepeateable and you can end up stuck. During the steps
that follow, the ORDS setup may/will:
</p>
<ul type="disc" class="red">
<li>Make modifications to resource files inside the ords.war file itself.</li>
<li>Write out or modify files in the <i>install directory</i>, in
particular to <tt>params/ords_params.properties</tt>.</li>
<li>Write subdirectories and files to a <i>configuration directory</i>.</li>
<li>Modify the state of your database.</li>
</ul>
<p class="red">
Because of these changes, ORDS installation/setup steps can exhibit a
&quot;memory effect&quot;, making it hard to correct mistakes. If need be,
your best hope of recovery is typically to start over with the pristine
ords.war file, params, and a completely empty configuration directory.
</p>
</b>
</blockquote>

<p>
In the steps that follow you will run ORDS operations from the command line.
You can see a list of commands this way:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre class="code">
java -jar ords.war help
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
You are running Java code within the ords.war file for these commands.
</p>

</dir>

<h4>Set up a configuration directory</h4>

<dir>

<p>
Run an ORDS command to establish a directory on your file system where ORDS
will store all its configuration information. I planned to eventually deploy
my ords.war to my Tomcat server, so I created a directory under my Tomcat
installation area:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre class="code">
mkdir /usr/local/tomcat/conf/ords
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
This directory should exist prior to running the <tt><b>configdir</b></tt>
command, which is as follows:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre class="code">
java -jar ords.war configdir /usr/local/tomcat/conf/ords
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p class="red"><b>
Note: this command modifies the ords.war file! It is now going to look in this
directory whenever you run commands from it. So, if you make a mistake later,
you may end up stuck, and wondering why you can't redo something, because
ORDS is &quot;remembering&quot; your previous mistakes. If necessary, remove
everything from this directory and start over again with a clean, original
copy of the <tt><b>ords.war</b></tt> file!
</b></p>

<p>
Conceptually, this directory is the place where ORDS will store all of the
information it needs to connect to your database and manage your URL
mappings. That is as distinct from the installation directory, which is
where you can run command-line actions against the <tt><b>ords.war</b></tt>
file and where some parameters that appear to be particular to the command-line
operations are stored. <span class="red">(It's unclear to me if
any of the files in the install directory, particularly the file
<tt><b>params/ords_params.properties</b></tt>, are still relevant once
you've deployed ORDS to your web application server.)</span>
</p>

</dir>

<h4>Do the initial ORDS installation</h4>

<dir>

<p>
Note: you may need to run some commands in sqlplus before performing the
ORDS installation! Please read the gotcha notes at the bottom of this
section before doing anything else. Prior to the ORDS installation described
here, you may need to run some sqlplus commands and/or do some non-ORDS-specific
setup on your database.
</p>

<p>
Note: after doing this, your <tt><b>params/ords_params.properties</b></tt>
file will be changed, with information captured from your answers to the
installation script. You may want to pre-edit this file prior to running
the install - this will default some of the answers for you. In particular,
one of the properties (the default tablespace name) is not prompted for
in the script, and if you do not have a tablespace with the exact name
ORDS uses (<tt><b>USERS</b></tt>), you'll get stuck. So, at least for that
one parameter, you <strong>must</strong> edit the file in advance if you
want an alternative. Here's what mine looked like:
</p>

<blockquote>
<table cellspacing="2" cellpadding="0" border="0">
<tr><td class="bgblack">
<table cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" border="0">
<tbody class="bgwhite">
<tr class="bgyellow">
<td><pre>
  db.hostname=dmcmahon-pc.us.oracle.com
  db.port=1521
  db.servicename=
  db.sid=ORCL
  db.username=APEX_PUBLIC_USER
  migrate.apex.rest=false
  rest.services.apex.add=
  rest.services.ords.add=true
  schema.tablespace.default=SYSAUX
  schema.tablespace.temp=TEMP
  standalone.http.port=8888
  standalone.static.images=/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ROOT/i
  user.tablespace.default=<span class="green">USERS2</span>
  user.tablespace.temp=TEMP
</pre></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>
You then run the installation:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre class="code">
java -jar ords.war install
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
Answer the scripted questions. If you did not edit the properties file,
you'll have to enter your database machine name, port number, and either
the SID or service name for the database. You will need the password for
the DBA account. At some point you'll be prompted to set up the ORDS
public user, which will run SQL commands against your database to set
up that account. At some point you will be prompted to set up the PL/SQL
Gateway, or not. You want to answer <tt><b>[1]</b></tt> to set this up!
You'll be asked to enter the password for the <tt>APEX_PUBLIC_USER</tt>. After
this, you may answer <tt><b>[2]</b></tt> to skip setting up RESTful
services if you don't need them. Then answer <tt><b>[2]</b></tt> to
finish the installation.
</p>

<p class="red"><b>
Important: possible &quot;gotcha&quot; issues!
</b></p>

<ul type="square" class="red">
<li>
You may need to unlock the account <tt>APEX_PUBLIC_USER</tt> from sqlplus
before you run the ORDS installation, if this hasn't been done already!
You'd do this from sqlplus as the DBA, with a command such as:<br>
<dir><tt class="blue">
alter user APEX_PUBLIC_USER identified by <i>YOUR_PASSWORD</i> account unlock;
</tt></dir>
</li>
<li>
You need to be sure that your DBA account is accessible by ORDS!
In particular it needs to be possible to connect to it via JDBC (sqlnet),
and it needs to have a password. This is something that tripped me up because
my development database allows me to connect to the DBA account using OS
authentication, e.g.:<br>
<dir><tt class="blue">sqlplus / as sysdba</tt></dir>
This won't work for ORDS, you need to be sure you can connect with a
password and database name, e.g.:<br>
<dir><tt class="blue">sqlplus sys@ORCL/manager as sysdba</tt></dir>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Note that this step may or may not modify the <tt><b>ords.war</b></tt> file.
It definitely writes data into <tt><b>params/ords_params.properties</b></tt>.
It also definitely populates some files in the configuration directory.
And, obviously, if you have it do the ORDS SQL setup, it modifies your
database.
</p>

</dir>

<h4>Enable ORDS for your schema</h4>

<dir>

<p>
This step is extremely important for ORDS to dispatch RESTful calls to
your application. <span class="red">(Although it's unclear if this is
necessary for the PL/SQL gateway - still, it can't hurt.)</span>
</p>

<p>
Log in to your database as the user/schema where your PL/SQL application
runs from. You can use sqlplus or SQL Developer. I used the
<tt><b>scott/tiger</b></tt> account so I logged in with:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre class="code">
sqlplus scott/tiger@ORCL
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
Once connected, run this script:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre class="code">
begin
  ords.enable_schema;
  commit;
end;
/
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
This registers your user/schema (in my case, <tt><b>scott</b></tt>) as a
dispatchable account for ORDS, and, <u>critically</u>, it allows the ORDS
public user to proxy-connect to your schema.
</p>

</dir>

<h4>Set up a database (connection pool) for your application</h4>

<dir>

<p>
This isn't necessary if, instead of setting up the APEX_PUBLIC_USER earlier,
you just set up your own user/schema instead. Basically you get one database
connection pool out-of-the-box. I kept the APEX_PUBLIC_USER as-is, so this
meant that I needed to set up another ORDS &quot;database&quot;
(really, connection pool) for my <tt>scott</tt> user/schema. That's
what this step does:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre class="code">
java -jar ords.war setup --database scott
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
In response to the scripted prompts, you give (or accept as defaults) the
same machine name, listener port number, SID or service name, etc. This
time enter <tt><b>[2]</b><tt> when prompted to skip verifying/installing
ORDS again. Then when prompted enter <tt><b>[1]</b></tt> to use the PL/SQL
Gateway. Here is where you can enter the username (<tt>scott</tt> in my
case) as the gateway username, and also enter the password (which is
<u>case-sensitive</u>, another gotcha, so I made sure to enter lower case
&quot;tiger&quot;). Enter <tt><b>[2]</b></tt> to skip RESTful services
again.
</p>

<p>
The effect of this is to set up another connection pool for the
<tt><b>scott/tiger</b></tt> user. Note that you can also use this to
connect to other databases, although in my case the connections are to
the same database, but just to another account. This is something I
wish I'd understood before attempting to get ORDS running the first time.
Also, note that while I chose to name my connection pool &quot;scott&quot;,
I didn't have to. The name of the pool and the name of the database
schema/user to connect to need not be the same.
</p>

<p>
If you go to the config directory you should see an XML file for this
pool in the <tt><b>conf</b></tt> sub-directory, e.g.
<tt><b>conf/scott.xml</b></tt>.
</i>

<p class="red">
There may be some way to avoid this step and have ORDS proxy over to the
<tt>scott</tt> user, but I can't figure out how to get that to work. Since
this is what modplsql does, I though that ORDS would work this way,
and I wasted my time trying in vain to get my application to run
without setting up a separate connection pool because I did not
understand that this apparently isn't allowed except for RESTful calls.
</p>

</dir>

<h4>Create a URL mapping for your application</h4>

<dir>

<p>
This is part two of the two-part setup for the equivalent of a modplsql DAD.
Here's what I did:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre class="code">
java -jar ords.war map-url --type base-path /scott scott
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
What this does is create a URL mapping, which should now show up in the
configuration directory in file <tt><b>url-mapping.xml</b></tt>. The
trailing string &quot;scott&quot; is the name of the database connection
pool to which this path (<tt>/scott</tt>) is bound. Once again note that
the pool name is the one you set up in the earlier step, and need not be
the database user/schema name.
</p>

<p class="red">
For reasons I don't understand, it's extremely important <strong>not</strong>
to specify an Apex workspace or database schema name at this step!
</p>

<p>
Note that you can pick any name for the URL portion of the mapping. I
chose <tt>/scott</tt> but I could have chosen <tt>/pls</tt> or really
almost anything else I needed.
</p>

</dir>

<h4>Switch on ORDS debugging</h4>

<dir>

<p>
In the configuration directory there is a file <tt><b>defaults.xml</b></tt>
which you can hand-edit to enable debugging. I always do this because no
matter how careful I am, I always make some mistake, and am then frustrated
because ORDS throws up 404 or 400 error pages with no information about what
I did wrong. Edit the file and change these two lines from
<span class="green">false</span> to <span class="green">true</span>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<table cellspacing="2" cellpadding="0" border="0">
<tr><td class="bgblack">
<table cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" border="0">
<tbody class="bgwhite">
<tr class="bgyellow">
<td><pre>
   &lt;entry key=&quot;debug.debugger&quot;&gt;<span class="green">true</span>&lt;/entry&gt;
   &lt;entry key=&quot;debug.printDebugToScreen&quot;&gt;<span class="green">true</span>&lt;/entry&gt;
</pre></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>
Note that if you've done just about anything wrong, you'll get 404 or 400 error
pages from ORDS. Even with the debugging information switched on, the pages
contain less-than-helpful messages such as &quot;...unable to dispatch...&quot;.
This includes little mistakes like giving the password for <tt>scott</tt>
in upper case instead of lower case! Unfortunately it seems quite sensitive
to minor mistakes and won't give you much of a clue as to what you've done
wrong.
</p>

</dir>

<h4>Implement the security callback</h4>

<dir>

<p>
After the installation, the ORDS <tt><b>defaults.xml</b></tt> file may contain
these lines:
</p>

<blockquote>
<table cellspacing="2" cellpadding="0" border="0">
<tr><td class="bgblack">
<table cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" border="0">
<tbody class="bgwhite">
<tr class="bgyellow">
<td><pre>
   &lt;entry key=&quot;security.requestValidationFunction&quot;&gt;<span class="green">wwv_flow_epg_include_modules.authorize</span>&lt;/entry&gt;
   &lt;entry key=&quot;security.validationFunctionType&quot;&gt;<span class="green">plsql</span>&lt;/entry&gt;
</pre></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p class="red">
Gotcha! This function almost certainly doesn't include your custom functions
on a &quot;whitelist&quot; of allowed functions, and so you will get 403 errors
from ORDS and you'll be wondering why. As a temporary testing measure, you can
just comment those lines out. For production use, you'll have to investigate
doing an actual implementation. For my test situation, I set this to call
<tt><b>MODOWA_TEST_PKG.AUTHORIZE(PROC_NAME in varchar2)</b></tt> which returns
TRUE for all procedures in the test package.
</p>

</dir>

<h4>Test your application with ORDS in stand-alone server mode</h4>

<dir>

<p>
You can run ORDS in the stand-alone mode, which runs the built-in Jetty
application server. This is the best way to debug problems because the
log output goes straight to your terminal window. (For example, when I
used upper case &quot;TIGER&quot; as the password, I got messages here
about how it was failing to start up the connection pool for
<tt><b>scott</b></tt>, which was just about the only way I was
told that I'd made that mistake.)

<blockquote>
<pre class="code">
java -jar ords.war standalone
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
Note that the first time you run it, you may need to give a port number
available on your machine. I used 8888 because 8080 (the default) is
in use on my machine by Tomcat. It was one of the things I hand-edited
in the <tt><b>params/ords_params.proprties</b></tt> file.
</p>

<p>
After you run this, a new file will appear in the configuration directory,
<tt><b>standalone/standalone.properties</b><tt>
</p>

<p>
If all has been done properly, your PL/SQL application should now be
accessible. I had previously installed the MODOWA_TEST_PKG to the
<tt><b>scott</b></tt> user, and so from firefox I entered this URL:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre class="code">
http://dmcmahon-pc.us.oracle.com:8888/ords/scott/modowa_test_pkg.test_plain
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
This worked! It showed me the timestamp from my database as expected!
</p>

<p class="red">
Gotcha! Notice that the URL you use for ORDS stand-alone has an extra
step, <tt>/ords</tt>, immediately following the host:port portion, and
<strong>before</strong> the part I thought I had configured (<tt>/scott</tt>).
This step appears to be &quot;hard-wired&quot; because it's the point where
ORDS itself is mounted into the built-in JETTY listener. I wasted countless
hours trying to figure out why I wasn't getting any response to the URL
that just started with <tt>/scott</tt> after the host:port; ORDS doesn't
even give an error message about the apparently unmapped URL, it just
produces no response and writes nothing to the output logs. It may be
that this mapping point can be renamed, but it's tricky - see below.
</p>

<p>
You can kill ORDS with control-C (on Unix, anyway). When it's down, you
may carefully edit the <tt><b>standalone/standalone.properties</b></tt>
if necessary. I changed the document root property to match Tomcat's
(though I'm not sure this was really necessary):
</p>

<blockquote>
<table cellspacing="2" cellpadding="0" border="0">
<tr><td class="bgblack">
<table cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" border="0">
<tbody class="bgwhite">
<tr class="bgyellow">
<td><pre>
standalone.doc.root=/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ROOT
</pre></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

</dir>

<h4>Deploy ORDS to your Web Application Server</h4>

<dir>

<p>
The point of all the previous steps was to make sure ORDS's flat-files
are all written to the file system correctly. Also note that several of
the steps modified the <tt><b>ords.war</b></tt> file itself.
</p>

<p>
I was deploying to Tomcat, which is installed on my machine at
<tt><b>/usr/local/tomcat</b></tt>. This is why, earlier, I used
<tt><b>/usr/local/tomcat/conf/ords</b></tt> as a configuration directory.
I want to have my entire Tomcat setup in a single file-system tree so I
can back it up easily, move it to another machine, etc.
</p>

<p>
I shut down Tomcat with the usual (for Unix) command:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre class="code">
/usr/local/tomcat/bin/shutdown.sh
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
I copied my <tt><b>ords.war</b></tt> file to the webapps folder:

<blockquote>
<pre class="code">
cp ords.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
Note that the <tt><b>ords.war</b></tt> has been modified by the previous steps,
in particular to store the location of the configuration directory. Most other
information is now in flat-files within the configuration directory. Warning:
the names of the sub-directories within the configuration directory appear to
be identical to the name of the war file.
</p>

<p>
Then I restarted Tomcat with the usual (for Unix) command:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre class="code">
/usr/local/tomcat/bin/startup.sh
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
By default, Tomcat will expand the ords.war into a sub-directory with the
same name, e.g. <tt><b>/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ords</b></tt> on my
machine. (In fact, it seems I can delete ords.war after the first-time use
and it still works, because everything that was in ords.war is now expanded.)
Tomcat will map ords to <tt><b>/ords</b></tt> in the URL space.
</p>

<p class="red">
Gotcha: you can't change the name of ords.war to, say, apex.war, pls.war,
or any other name at this point in order to change where the application
server maps it - you need to have done that at an earlier step! More on
this below, along with a possible work-around.
</p>

<p>
Now, I can access my application with:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre class="code">
http://dmcmahon-pc.us.oracle.com:8080/ords/scott/modowa_test_pkg.test_plain
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
Note that the first time access may be slow because it has to load the servlet
and spin up the connection pools.
</p>

</dir>

<h4>Changing the URL mapping point</h4>

<dir>

<p>
If for some reason you need to change the mapping point, then, at least in
Tomcat, you can rename the <tt><b>ords.war</b></tt> to the other mapping
point before the first-time deployment and expansion. For example, you can
change the name to <tt><b>pls.war</b></tt>. This would then mean that the
URLs to access your application would look like this:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre class="code">
http://dmcmahon-pc.us.oracle.com:8080/<span class="green"><u>pls</u></span>/scott/modowa_test_pkg.test_plain
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
If you've already expanded to <tt><b>webapps/ords</b></tt> and removed the
war file, you can rename the directory to change the mapping point, e.g.
change <tt><b>ords</b></tt> to <tt><b>pls</b></tt>.
</p>

<p class="red">
The problem is, ORDS will look in the wrong places in the configuration
directory for flat-files! I believe that to do the above properly, you
should rename ords.war before the very first step, i.e. before running
the <tt><b>configdir</b></tt> command. All other commands would then
substitute your <tt><b><i>xxx</i>.war</b></tt> file where the ORDS war
file would normally appear. I believe the issue is that ORDS uses the
name of the servlet mapping point as the name of the sub-directory it
looks for in the configuration directory. Because of this, it may be
possible to rename the sub-directory to work around the problem. For
example on my machine:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre class="code">
cd /usr/local/tomcat/webapps
mv ords.war pls.war

cd /usr/local/tomcat/conf/ords
mv ords pls
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
This worked for me, but I can't guarantee that all possible references
(stored in the war file, stored in the xml files, etc.) are relative and
would pivot to this change.
</p>

<p>
For ORDS stand-alone, it does appear as if the mapping point can be changed
by renaming, but you have to change all of the following:
</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>rename ords.war, e.g. to pls.war</li>
<li>rename the conf directory <tt>ords</tt> subdirectory to e.g.
<tt>pls</tt></li>, matching the new name of the .war file</li>
<li>Edit the standalone.properties file and change the entry for
<span class="blue">standalone.context.path</span> to e.g. <tt>pls</tt>,
matching the new name of the .war file</li>
</ul>

<p class="red">
One last question that I can't answer: is the file
<tt><b>params/ords_params.properties</b></tt> still relevant after deployment?
It seems from the usage that this file is only used when you run ORDS
installation steps from the command line, although it also may be relevant
when you run it in stand-alone mode.

<dt><b>Database authentication</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>
modplsql has the ability to do HTTP Basic authentication by connecting
to the database as the username specified in the Basic challenge box,
using the password given in the Basic challenge box. It could then run
your PL/SQL request as that database user. Some modplsql and mod_owa
customers run in this manner, with each user given a distinct database
account. It's not clear how to make ORDS work in this manner.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Proxying connections</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>
ORDS can run a single shared connection pool and, by proxying, run RESTful
services against different schemas, provided they are configured to allow
ORDS to proxy (as described earlier). The problem is that I can't seem to
get ORDS to do this for PL/SQL Gateway requests. Is it even possible?
</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>File upload/download</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>
ORDS has a parameter for setting the staging table that is roughly equivalent
to <tt><b>PlsqlDocumentTablename</b></tt>. It's <tt><b>apex.docTable</b></tt>.
The documentation is a bit vague as to whether this would be put in
<tt><b>defaults.xml</b></tt> (a file found in the configuration directory)
or in one of the connection-pool files (e.g. <tt><b>conf/scott.xml</b></tt>).
</p>
<p>
ORDS doesn't support an equivalent of <tt><b>PlsqlDocumentProcedure</b></tt>.
If your application needs this feature, you'll have to work around the issue
by coding a REST service endpoint. That's beyond the scope of this simple guide.
A future version of ORDS will add this functionality.
</p>
<p class="red">
Gotcha: ORDS looks to see if <tt><b>APEX_UTIL.FILE_UPLOAD</b></tt> is
installed in your database. This happens at run-time. If this procedure is
available, it's used to upload files <u>instead of the staging table</u>.
Newer versions of Apex expect this (and mod_owa doesn't support it). If
your legacy non-Apex application relies on a staging table, having Apex
installed in your database will trigger this new behavior and file
upload/download will appear not to work for your application. As a
work-around, you might be able to hide this package by manually revoking
execute permission on <tt><b>APEX_UTIL</b></tt> from your application's
run-time user. For example, since I was testing as user <tt><b>SCOTT</b></tt>,
it was sufficient for me to revoke execute on that package from user SCOTT,
making it invisible to ORDS and causing ORDS to use the staging table instead.

<dt><b>Flexible argument calling conventions</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>
The PL/SQL gateway has two calling conventions for flexible argument passing,
both triggered by prepending an exclamation mark (!) ahead of the package
and procedure name in the URL. The two-argument form passed two PL/SQL
index-by tables of VARCHAR2 values, one with names and the other with values.
The four-argument form passes a count of arguments, and then three index-by
tables, one for names, one for values, and the last reserved (and unused).
</p>

<p class="red">
Gotcha: ORDS only seems to support the 2-argument form.
<p>

<p>
Moreover, OAS was able to automatically rewrite calls that lacked the
required (!) prefix into flexible argument calls by doing describes on
packages and procedures and then invoking the procedure using the flexible
argument calling method. ORDS is not able to do this.
</p>

<p>
The only solution is to ensure that your flexbile argument procedures use
the 2-argument form, and that your URLs conform to the specification with
the (!) prefix. If necessary, you can overload a procedure with a
2-argument form that calls your existing 4-argument version using code
such as this:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre class="code">
procedure <span class="green">YOUR_FUNCTION</span>(NAME_ARRAY  in OWA.VC_ARR,
                        VALUE_ARRAY in OWA.VC_ARR) is
begin
  <span class="green">YOUR_FUNCTION</span>(least(NAME_ARRAY.count(),VALUE_ARRAY.count()),
                NAME_ARRAY, VALUE_ARRAY, VALUE_ARRAY);
end;
/
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
Another behavior that OAS apparently supported was parameter promotion and
demotion. This was done by describing the procedure being called, and if
necessary treating a single-value parameter as if it were an array of one
value (promotion to array) or by ignoring all but the first of a multi-value
parameter (demotion to a string). This behavior was never documented in
modplsql. ORDS appears to handle these situations.

<dt><b>Flat-files needed after deployment</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>
I'm not clear on whether any files from the install directory, particularly
<tt><b>params/ords_params.properites</b><tt>, are used when it's deployed
to an application server. These properties appear to be relevant whenever
you run a command-line operation such as the installation steps above.
But what about when running ORDS stand-alone from the command line, do they
still matter? All the database information (for the connection pools) appears
to be present in the files within the <i>configuration</i> directory. Even
the ORDS stand-alone properties (such as the port number for Jetty to use)
appear to be present in the configuration directory (in
<tt><b>standalone/standalone.properties</b><bb>). So does the <i>install</i>
directory matter once you've completed the installation?
